  <td><strong>DR BACA: Dynamic Role Based Access Control</strong></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Aiming to support the Principle of Least Privilege, we propose and implement a Dynamic Role Based Access Control for Android (DR BACA) model to enhance Android security, particularly in corporate environment. Our system offers multi-user management on   Android mobile devices comparable to traditional workstations, and provides fine-grained Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to enhance Android security at both the application     and permission level. Moreover, by leveraging context-aware capabilities of mobile devices and Near Field communication (NFC) technology, our solution supports dynamic RBAC to provide more flexible access control while still being able to mitigate some of the most serious security risks on mobile devices. The DR BACA system can easily be managed, even in large business environments with many mobile devices.</td>
